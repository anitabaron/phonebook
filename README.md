## Technologies

The Phonebook App is built using:

- **React/Redux**  
  The application is built using React to create dynamic and reusable UI components, while Redux is used for managing the global state in a predictable way. This combination allows for a scalable and maintainable architecture.

- **HTML5 & CSS3**  
  Utilized for the structure and styling of the application, ensuring a modern, responsive design.

- **JavaScript (ES6+) with TypeScript**  
  Powers the application's functionality with modern syntax and features, while TypeScript enhances code quality through type safety and improved maintainability.
